#ToDo 写出星型模型设计理论框架

#ToDo 减价的时候，购买Udemy课程进行观看

Star Model
	Information System
		Operational Systems
Business Process (OLTP)
Entity-relationship model
			高性能的 Insert, Update, Delete 增删改的原子级操作
			随业务更新，抛弃历史信息
			ACID原则
				Atomic 原子级
				Consistent 一致性
				Isolated 独立性
				Durable 持续性
			3rd normal form 数据库三范式
				1NF 列不可再分
				2NF 属性完全依赖于主键
				3NF 属性不依赖于其它非主属性    属性直接依赖于主键
		Analytic Systems
Analytic Purpose (OLAP)
			高性能的 Query，整体数据的查询
			历史数据依然保留
	Data Warehouse Architecture
		Inmon's Corporate Information Factory
		Kimball's Dimensional Data Warehouse
		Stand-Alone Data Marts
		Architecture and Dimensional Design
	Stars Model
		Dimension Table Features
			Track History
				Key + Sequence Number
				Key + Time Stamp
				Surrogate Keys (SK) and Natural Keys (NK)
			Rich Set of Dimensions
				Wide and Short
				Common Combinations
				Codes and Descriptions
				Flags (Y/N, T/F, 1/0)
				Labels (for calculation)
				Multiple-Part Columns
				Dimensions with Numeric Values (Unit Price)
					how to distinguish them from fact?
see how they are used
				behavioral dimension
					e.g. 留存，转化，新增
e.g. 重要客户分类
			Grouping Dimensions into Dimension Tables
				Based on Affinity
				Junk Dimensions ( no affinity)
				Snowflakes and Outriggers
					Less Redundancy
					Good for Operational Systems
					Hierarchies ( Report Items )
					A big no for dimensional design
				Benefits of Redundancy
( why not on the fly )
					Performance
					Usability
					Consistency
		Fact Table Features
			Fact Tables and Processes
				Facts are core for measurements
				Short and Deep
				Almost all columns are numbers
			Capturing Facts
				Additive Facts
					Capture All Measurements as Possible
					Compute Margin in Advance
						For Performance
						For Consistency
					Do not store unit amounts => store extended amounts
				Nonadditive Facts
					Percentage
					YtY%, Margin%, Market Ratio%
					Break them down into additive facts
					should not stored in fact tables but should be documented
				Semi-additive Facts
					balance sheet
			Grain
				Ensure a same level of details record
				Should be confirmed at the very beginning of a project
				Other details will be grouped into a single row
				Try to keep the most granular data possible ( in the staging schema )
				Grouping discard useful information; need to start over if xxx
				If performance is not good, create aggregated table in the data mart or in the star model
				Sparsity
		Degenerate Dimensions
			Junk Dimensions
			Avoid overusing
		Slowly Changing Dimensions
			Dimension Tables' data is from operational systems
			identify how changes in source data will be represented
			Type 1 slow change - retroactively altered - overwrite
				Confusion
				Do not track change
			Type 2 slow change - preserve (ETL process)
				Insert a new record into dimension
				Create different versions of dimension
				Confusion for duplicate data - use current flag
				Surogate key preserves historic context, but not history - add version date

		SSAS, Clickhouse
		Column storage core
		Pre-calculation of different dimensions
		Limitation - Curse of Dimensionality
